#The script indicates that it is something running on localhost:4747. Verbose port scan for listening daemons, without sending any data to them.Script expects a value passed in x parameter which is passed to x() function. Then, while printing it, backticks are used to evaluate argument by echoing it.So trying to pass whoami command substitution reveals that is evaluated and executed as flag04.
- curl '127.0.0.1:4747/?x=$(/usr/bin/whoami)'
flag04
- curl '127.0.0.1:4747/?x=$(/bin/getflag)'
