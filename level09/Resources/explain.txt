#In our home directory, we see an executable with suid/guid and a token file that we can read but which content seems encrypted:
- ls -l

total 12
-rwsr-sr-x 1 flag09 level09 7640 Mar  5  2016 level09
----r--r-- 1 flag09 level09   26 Mar  5  2016 token

- cat token
f4kmm6p|=�p�n��DB�Du{��

#We know the file expects an argument:
- ./level09
You need to provide only one arg.

# Let's figure out what the executable does:
- ./level09 token
tpmhr
- ./level09 hello
hfnos

# the executable expects a string as an argument, and encodes it by rotating each character by an incrementing index. for example: token

t  o  k  e  n
+0 +1 +2 +3 +4
t  p  m  h  r

# create a simple C file decrypt.c to decrypt this (decript.c in current directiry)
# save level09 token in local machine:
- scp -P 4242 level09@127.0.0.1:~/token token

- gcc decrypt.c -o decrypt
- ./decrypt `cat token`
Token is: f3iji1ju5yuevaus41q1afiuq
